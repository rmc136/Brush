# Brush
Its a 3 player game with a deck of cards of 40 cards (excluding 8/9/10s) the rest of the cards are exactly the same. Each player starts with 3 cards in their hand. one of them is going to be dealt first in the first round and the it goes anti-clockwise. Next round it starts on the next player and so on. after the cards were dealt to the players u put 4 cards in the middle (ONLY ONCE IN THE BEGGINING). The player who received the cards first starts fist. The objective of the game is to make points, by collecting sevens and diamonds. Each seven is a point and each diamond is a point, with the 7 of diamonds being 2 points. To make points you need to get a sum that gives 15 with a card (CAN ONLY BE ONE) that you played and as many as you want in the table (THE SUM NEEDS TO BE 15). The Queen is 8, Jack 9, King 10, Ace 1, the rest as their number value. If you cant make 15 just play the card that you see fit to not let the other player make 15. If your "15" clears all the cards in the table, you have made a brush and make 1 extra point. After you played 3 cards go grab 3 more until theres no more cards in the deck. The last cards on the table on the last "hand" goes to the last player. Wins the player with more points, in case of a tie, the player with more total cards in their points stach wins. If they have the same number of cards its a coin flip
